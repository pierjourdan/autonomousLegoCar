# Self-driving lego car
Here we create software for an autonomous lego car. The car uses lego power function motor and servomotor. An arduino and a motor shield drive the motor and servomotor. An android phone, connected via usb to the arduino, is use for the sensor (camera), the acces to internet, etc...
You can find programs for arduino and for android, and some photos to show you the hardware connections.
